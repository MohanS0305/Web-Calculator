# Web-Calculator

The Web Calculator project is a simple yet functional online calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to create an interactive and user-friendly calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can access this calculator through a web browser on their desktop or mobile devices, making it convenient and accessible.

User-Friendly Interface: The calculator features a clean and intuitive user interface resembling a traditional handheld calculator. It includes numeric buttons, operation buttons, and a display area to show input and results.

Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform common arithmetic calculations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator ensures accurate calculations and maintains proper order of operations.

Responsive Design: The calculator's interface is responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Numeric Input: Users can input numbers by clicking the numeric buttons on the calculator interface. Keyboard input is also supported for enhanced usability.

Operation Buttons: The calculator includes buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), allowing users to select their desired operation easily.

Clear and Reset: A 'Clear' button allows users to clear the current input, while a 'Reset' button clears all input and resets the calculator to its initial state.

Decimal Point: The calculator supports decimal point input, enabling users to perform calculations involving decimal numbers.

Dynamic Display: The display area of the calculator dynamically updates as users input numbers and operations, showing both the current input and the calculated result.

Technologies Used:

HTML: HTML is used to structure the calculator interface, including buttons and the display area.

CSS: CSS is used for styling and layout, making the calculator visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript: JavaScript is the core programming language that powers the calculator's functionality. It handles user interactions, performs arithmetic operations, and updates the display in real-time.


Conclusion:
The Web Calculator project is a hands-on application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, creating a functional tool that users can access and use directly from their web browser. It's an ideal project for beginners to practice front-end development and gain a deeper understanding of user interface design and interactive web applications.
